   - Note: The application may fail to run if environment variables are not properly configured

5. **Generate sample data** (Optional)

   ```sh
   # Generate and upload flights data to MongoDB
   # This will creates 10 days of flight data but deletes all flight data from db before uploading
   # If you want to add more flight data without deleting, use `/api/cronjob/flight_schedule` api endpoint
   npm run generateAndUploadFlightsDB

   # Generate flights data files
   npm run generateFlightsFiles

   # Generate and upload hotels data to MongoDB
   npm run generateAnduploadHotelsDB

   # Generate hotels data files
   npm run generateHotelsFiles
   ```

   Files will be generated in `./generated` directory.

6. **Start the development server**

   ```sh
   npm run dev
